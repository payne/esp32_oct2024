# Introduction to ESP32 for DIY Electronics Hobbyists

---

## What is ESP32?

- Powerful, low-cost microcontroller
- Built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth
- Perfect for IoT projects
- Developed by [Espressif Systems](https://www.espressif.com/)

---

## What to Buy: Getting Started Kit

1. ESP32 development board (e.g., ESP32-WROOM-32)
2. Micro-USB cable
3. Breadboard
4. Jumper wires
5. Basic components (LEDs, resistors, buttons)
6. Optional: sensors (temperature, humidity, motion)

---

## Development Environments

1. [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)
   - Easy to use for beginners
   - Extensive library support

2. [ESP-IDF](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/) (Espressif IoT Development Framework)
   - More advanced, full-featured
   - Better performance and control

3. [MicroPython](https://micropython.org/)
   - Python-based programming
   - Great for rapid prototyping

---

## Setting Up Arduino IDE for ESP32

1. Install [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)
2. Add ESP32 board manager URL in Preferences
3. Install ESP32 board package
4. Select your ESP32 board model
5. Choose the correct port

## Example Project: LED Blink with Web Control

### Hardware Setup

1. Connect an LED to GPIO 2 (with a 220Î© resistor)
2. Power your ESP32 via USB

### Source Code
1. [(Arduino/C++)](blink.cpp)
2. [(MicroPython)](blink.py)

### Running the Project

1. Update Wi-Fi credentials in the code
2. Upload the sketch to your ESP32
3. Open Serial Monitor to get the IP address
4. Visit the IP address in a web browser
5. Click the "Toggle LED" button to control the LED
